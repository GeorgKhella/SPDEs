# Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs)

This repository contains the LaTeX source and supporting materials for the semester project titled **"Stochastic Partial Differential Equations"**, authored by Georg Khella (March 2025). The project provides a rigorous introduction to SPDEs, with a focus on stochastic integration in Hilbert spaces and applications to nonlinear variational problems.

## üìò Abstract

We develop the theory of stochastic integration in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, focusing on the construction of the It√¥ integral and its extension to cylindrical Brownian motions. Using this framework, we formulate and prove the well-posedness of a class of nonlinear SPDEs in variational form. The theory is applied to a concrete example involving the 4-Laplacian with additive trace-class noise, and complemented with an energy identity and long-time behavior analysis under stochastic forcing.
